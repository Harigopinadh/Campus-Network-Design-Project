📚 XYZ University Network Design Project
📖 Project Overview
This project is a full network design and implementation for XYZ University, which has two campuses situated approximately 50 miles apart. The network connects four faculties:

Faculty of Health and Sciences

Faculty of Business

Faculty of Engineering/Computing

Faculty of Art and Design

Each department has its own dedicated network (VLANs and Subnets). Routers, switches, servers, and PCs are configured to meet the university’s technical requirements, with security policies enforced using ACLs.
